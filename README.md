In this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of styling a modern web application using Tailwind CSS's utility classes, as well as some tips and tricks for integrating it with component-based frameworks like React and Vue.

Functional CSS has been growing in popularity, and for good reason: it allows developers to build truly custom user interfaces without using any messy tweaks or overrides that have plagued existing tools like Bootstrap for years.

When it comes to Functional CSS libraries, Tailwind is the reigning champ. By several measures, it’s one of the hottest pieces of tech right now in all of frontend web development. Its APIs make developers feel incredibly productive, and because it's just a set of well-thought-out CSS classes, you can use it entirely from within your HTML templates or render functions without having to learn any new tooling, or even opening up a separate file.

If you're a web developer interested in front-end design and development, you owe it to yourself to give Tailwind a try, if only to not miss out on one of the biggest new trends in our industry.
